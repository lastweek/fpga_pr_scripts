# Vivado Partial Reconfiguration Script Template

For what is worth, this is super useful.

Everything is script-based here, but you can open the GUI explicitly via `start_gui`.

All checkpoint files, vivado commands will be saved.


## Run

Check the Makefile and bash script first.

You can do `make`, `make clean`.
